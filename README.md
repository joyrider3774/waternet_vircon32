## Playing the Game:
The aim of the game, in any game mode is always to connect all pipes so that water can flow through them from the water point source. How you can accomplish this depends on the game mode. The game has a help section in the main menu where you can always check up on the rules of each game mode. The game has 375 levels, spread over 3 game mode each with 5 difficulties, so thats 25 levels per difficulty / game mode. To top that off the game also provides a random difficulty which will generate never ending, random levels for the game mode you had chosen.

## Game Modes
The Game has 3 game modes

### Rotate Mode
You need to connect all the pipes so water flows through them, by pressing the A button on a pipe, to rotate the single pipe.

### Slide Mode
